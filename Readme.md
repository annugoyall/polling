## This is a Django project that demonstrates short polling and long polling implementations.

## Short Polling

### Advantages

- Simple to implement and understand.
- Real-time updates for clients as soon as new data is available.
- Easy to implement

### Disadvantages

- Frequent polling can lead to increased server load and higher bandwidth usage.
- Latency in data updates as clients have to wait for the next poll interval.
- Increased traffic and load on the server even when there is no new data.
- Not suitable for applications requiring real-time or low-latency updates.

## Long Polling

### Advantages

- Real-time updates without the need for frequent polling.
- Reduced server load compared to short polling for scenarios with low update frequency.

### Disadvantages

- More complex to implement than short polling.
- Still introduces some latency as clients wait for responses from the server.
- Increased server resource usage as each client connection is held open until data is available.
- Not suitable for scenarios with very high update frequency or a large number of clients.
